# DoMeWhen-Classic
### Baneto Bot optimized DoMeWhen-Classic Version (bntapi and wmbapi)
This is the core rotation addon of DoMeWhen, it does not contain any rotations, 
it only contains the functions needed for rotations to work, and a handful of helper functions.

## Installation
Download zip on github, extract to your classic addons folder and remove the "-master" from directory name.

## Installing Rotations
Rotations are installed as seperate addons, so when you find a rotation you want to use, you follow same instructions as above for installation.

## Usage In-game
Config can be opened either by clicking the minimap icon, or typing /DMW in chat window.
